          <h3>About me</h3>
          <p class="text">I am Nhat Pham, a rising senior in Data Science and Strategic Finance at Minerva Schools at KGI. I got interested in risk management since my sophomore year when I had the first lessons about option pricing. Then, I started researching more about the role and looking for internship opportunities. In that summer, I luckily landed in a position in the most resource-intensive credit rating project of PwCâ€™s advisory team in Vietnam. During the internship, I shadowed all senior team members to learn more about statistics, modeling, and credit risk management. And I loved my summer and people there a lot.</p>

          <p class="text">During my junior year, I applied to countless firms but did not have many calls back. Goldman Sachs was the only firm I had a super day for Risk SA 2020. Unfortunately, I did not get the offer (but that's why I have time working on my own project this summer :-).</p>

          <p class="text">I am still pursuing risk management as a career path after graduation and doing some side projects as well as networking with risk people to prepare myself better for this role. If you have interests in this project or happen to know full-time opportunities in banking and in risk management, please email me via nhat.pham@minerva.kgi.edu </p>

          <h3>About the project</h3>
          <p class="text">The project covers valuation topics over various financial instruments. So far, it mainly focuses on valuing equity and derivatives using both fundamental and technical analyses. The reason I learned HTML/CSS from scratch to build this website is to attach valuation machines (in Python) with my explanation. And I hope it will make valuation techniques and complicated financial products more comprehensive to audience, especially those don't have finance background.</p>
